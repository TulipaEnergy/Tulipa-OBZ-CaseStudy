## Updating the repo

If you have an error after updating your repository, consider, delete the Manifest.TOML in your project folder and instantiate the julia enviroment again to get the latest updated packages.

## How to add a new asset

1. Go to the folder `user-input-files` and then add the asset to the correspondent `asset-XXX-basic-data.csv` and the `asset-XXX-year-data.csv`
2. (optional) Go to the `profiles.csv` and add the profile for the asset
3. If you have a new profile then go to the `assets-profiles.csv` to define the link between the assets and the profile. Also for other technologies than VRE production (such as for hydro storage)
4. Go to the files `flows-assets-connections-basic-data.csv` and `flows-assets-connections-yearly-data.csv` add a row to link the new asset to a existing (or new) one with the correspondent informations for each file
