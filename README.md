# How to add a new asset

1. Go to the folder `user-input-files` and then add the asset to the correspondent `asset-XXX-basic-data.csv` and the `asset-XXX-year-data.csv`
2. (optional) Go to the `profiles.csv` and add the profile for the asset
3. If you have a new profile then go to the `assets-profiles.csv` to define the link between the assets and the profile. Also for other technologies than VRE production (such as for hydro storage)
4. Go to the files `flows-assets-connections-basic-data.csv` and `flows-assets-connections-yearly-data.csv` add a row to link the new asset to a existing (or new) one with the correspondent informations for each file
